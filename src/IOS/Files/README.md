## Files

A virtual file system, every app can use this to store data and files. Experimentation needs to be done here to see what we can store. Simple documents, json objects, etc can be stored in local storage, but full on files need to stored somewhere. The Files app will integrate with this, in the same way the Launcher app is a display for the Apps Manager.
